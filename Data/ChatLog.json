It's characterized by its ability to perceive its environment, reason about the current state of affairs, and make decisions to achieve its goals, often in real-time.\n\nThink of agentic AI as a highly advanced \"agent\" that can operate independently, making decisions and taking actions without human intervention. This has significant implications for various fields, including robotics, healthcare, finance, and more."
